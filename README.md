# Mkmap-in-SwiftUI
SwiftUI is an innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift.
Build user interfaces for any Apple device using just one set of tools and APIs. With a declarative Swift syntax that’s easy to read and natural to write, 
SwiftUI works seamlessly with new Xcode design tools to keep your code and design perfectly in sync. 
Automatic support for Dynamic Type, Dark Mode, localization, and accessibility means your first line of SwiftUI code is already the most powerful UI code you’ve ever written.

In this project I want to show how to create UiKit components in SwiftUi thanks to  "UIViewRepresentable" method: 

---> Introducing MkMapView in SwiftUI without import the Uikit Framework, 

---> create this Coordinator to communicate with SwiftUI View

---> create makeUiView() method that will return our MKMapView and updateUIView() method that will be called whenever the text data view has changed.

---> customize the AnnotationView, like clustering the pin on the map
